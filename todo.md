## bugs

- [x] the svg icons does not appear in download or open mode
  - reason: svg string does not contain svg files
- [ ] in () => table, add `port` to cells
- [ ] in () => table, add styling at least for the table
- [x] in () => table, adds `,` between `td`s
- [x] in () => table, !/url become image=.. instead of <img>
- [ ] in () => table, maybe to have ()() like record shape.
- [ ] change image size to 2mm and use imagescale
- [x] isolate innerSvg styles from each other (PubSub and Cloud-Run)

## features

- [ ] work on record-based shapes
- [x] export to pure DOT notation
- [ ] adding classes
- [x] variables
- [ ] themes
